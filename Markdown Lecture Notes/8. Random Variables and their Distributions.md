## Random Variables
(Start from the second part of lecture 6 handwritten notes)

A **Random Variable** is a function from the _Sample Space_ $S$ to $\mathbb{R}$.
We can think of it as a numerical "summary" of an aspect of our experiments. 
[Our experiments are our source of randomness]

Essentially, thye're a mapping from the outputs of an experiment to real numbers.

#### Bernoulli Distribution
A random variable $X$ is said to have a $Bern(p)$ distribution if $X$ has only $2$ possible values, $0$ and $1$, where:
$$P(X=1) = p, \\  P(X=0) = 1 - p = q$$

$[X=1]$ is an event $\{S : X(S) = 1 \}$: which includes all outputs which are assigned to the number $1$ by th random variable.

### Bionomial Distribution
The distribution of $\#successes$ in $n$ independent $Bern(p)$ experiments is called the $Bin(n, p)$, where it is given by:
$$
P(X=k) = {n \choose k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} \quad \text{for } 0 \leq k \leq n
$$
