If every function of $X$ is uncorrelated with every function of $Y$, then they're independent.
(Covariance shows linear dependence.)

[Covariance is making things dimensionless, so we won't have to deal with whether we're using nanometers or light-years. => Variance : unit^2, SD: unit, (x - ex) / sd = 1] => Takes it from whatever mean and variance to mean = 0 and variance 1
