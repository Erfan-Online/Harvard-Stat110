## Definitions

A *sample space* is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

An *event* is a subset of the sample state.

e.g.   
_Sample Space_: The set of all results of  rolling 2 dice.  
_Event_: $ [6, 6] $


### Naive definition of Probability 
$$P(A) = \frac{\text{\\#Favorable  outcomes}} {\text{\\#Possible outcomes}} $$  
The naive definition assumes:  
1. All outcomes are equally likely
2. Sample space is finite and countable.

## Counting
1. Multiplication rule: 
    If there are $n_1$ ways to do task 1, and $n_2$ ways to do task 2, then there are $n_1 \times n_2$ ways to do both tasks.  
    Example: When buying ice cream, picking the cone type **and** the flavor. (dependence makes it more complicated)

2. Addition rule: 
    If there are $n_1$ ways to do task 1, and $n_2$ ways to do task 2, then there are $n_1 + n_2$ ways to one task.
    Example: Three types of ice cream **or** two types of pizza.


#### Binomial Coefficient
$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \space , \space 0 \text{   if k > n}
$$

_Narrative_: #Subsets of size $k$ from a set of size $n$.


### Sampling Table:

|                          | Order matters        | Order doesn't matter |
| -------------            | :-------------:      | :-------------:      |
| **With Replacement**     | $n^k$                | $\binom{n+k-1}{k}$   |
| **Wihtout Replacement**  | $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$  | $\binom{n}{k}$       |
