### Homework hints
1. Don't lose common sense.
    You will see counter-intuitive stuff, but you shouldn't abandon common sense. (e.g. "There aren't 13.4 ways to do this task.")

2. Do check your answers.
    Especially by doing both **simple** and **extreme** cases. [Check what you can count manually, and check the $\infty$ limit as well.]

3. Label people, objects, etc. 
    If you have $n$ people, label them $1, 2, 3, ..., n$.

##### Example
_Question_: We have $10$ people, divide them into two groups of $6$ and $4$.

_Answer_: 
$$\binom{10}{4} = \binom{10}{6}$$
Narrative: We pick the $4$ (or $6$) people to be in the first group, then the remaining $6$ (or $4$) people are in the second group.

##### Example
_Question_: We have $10$ people, divide them into two groups of $5$.

_Answer_: 
$$ \frac{1}{2} \times \binom{10}{5}$$

Narrative: We choose $5$ for the first group, then the remaining $5$ people are in the second team.
But, this is symmetrical with regards to which team is the one picked first, which means we're double counting.
[Note that this symmetry arises because we never specified there was any difference between the two teams. But if we had said that one would be the blue team and the other the red team, then we would have to actually double count.]

Note: In probability, doing nothing and not being able to do anything are **different** things. There is $1$ way to do nothing, and there are $0$ ways of not being able to do anything.
